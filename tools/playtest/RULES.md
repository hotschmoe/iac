# In Amber Clad: live playtest rules

You are one of six AI players in a live, shared game of In Amber Clad, a
tick-based space strategy MMO (OGame x The Infinite Black). The server ticks
once per second, so the world keeps moving while you think. Other players
(other AIs, and maybe a human on the web UI) share the same hex galaxy.

The session lasts about one hour. Every `play` call prints the minutes left.
Play the whole hour: keep queues busy, keep fleets doing something, and use
`play wait 60` while timers run instead of stopping. Do not end your session
early. When under 6 minutes remain, write your feedback (see the end).

Your goal: grow the strongest empire you can by the end of the hour (resources,
buildings, research, ships) while exploring and surviving. Your choice of
strategy; take risks if you like. Be a good sport: no attempts to break the
server, no spamming it faster than about one command per second.

## Your tool: `play` (run it from your player directory)

```
./play status            empire, queues, fleets, and the sector each fleet sits in
./play map [radius]      every sector you have seen near your fleets, marked LIVE or STALE <age>
./play sector Q R        one sector in detail (same LIVE / STALE marking)
./play do '<json>'       send one command (JSON, see reference below); prints errors/events
./play events [--mine]   events since you last looked; --mine hides fights you only witnessed
./play wait [5-90]       sleep, then show events (use this to pass time)
./play rules             this file
```

Moving: `move` targets must be a sector listed in your fleet's `exits` (the
direction labels E/NE/NW/W/SW/SE are shown). Each jump costs fuel and puts the
fleet on cooldown. `scan` reveals nearby sectors so you can plan routes.

Keep short notes in `notes.md` in your directory (plans, what worked), so you
can pick up where you left off if your session is restarted.

### Command reference (stdin)

| action | fields | effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `move` | `fleet_id`, `target:{q,r}` | jump to a connected sector (fuel, cooldown) |
| `scan` | `fleet_id` | reveal nearby sectors + faint signal contacts; scouts scan farther |
| `harvest` | `fleet_id`, `resource` (`Metal`, `Crystal`, `Deuterium`, `Auto`) | mine the current sector until cargo is full; `Auto` takes everything present, a named resource only that one (`ResourceNotPresent` if the sector lacks it) |
| `attack` | `fleet_id`, `target_fleet_id` | engage the NPC fleet listed as HOSTILE in your sector (use its id) |
| `collect_salvage` | `fleet_id` | scoop wreckage (partial if the hold fills; `CargoFull` if it is already full) |
| `recall` | `fleet_id` | emergency-jump home (2× fuel, hull risk) |
| `stop` | `fleet_id` | abort a move, harvest, or boarding |
| `explore_site` | `fleet_id` | board the derelict in the current sector (20t, ambush risk) |
| `build` | `building_type` | queue a homeworld building upgrade |
| `research` | `tech` | queue research |
| `build_ship` | `ship_class`, `count` | queue ship production |
| `cancel_build` | `queue_type` | cancel with 50% refund |

Standing orders are a separate message type (not a command):

```json
{"type":"policy_update","fleet_id":2,"preset":"salvage_and_sites",
 "params":{"min_fuel_pct":30,"cargo_return_pct":85,"max_range":4,"engage_ratio_x10":12}}
```

Presets: `manual` (clears orders), `prospect` (scan + push the frontier),
`mine_and_return` (shuttle ore between a claim and home), `salvage_and_sites`
(scoop wreckage, board derelicts), `patrol_home` (hunt hostiles near home).
`params` is optional. Every autopilot act emits a `PolicyAction` event with a
human-readable `reason` — an audit trail for agents (and captains).

## The game

- **Economy** — metal / crystal / deuterium from homeworld mines and fleet
  harvesting. Sector deposits deplete and regenerate.
- **Buildings** — 8 types incl. Shipyard, Research Lab, Sensor Array (passive
  reveal around home) and Defense Grid (see raids).
- **Research** — 12 techs: hulls, shields, weapons, fuel, navigation, ship
  class unlocks, emergency jump.
- **Fleets** — up to 3 deployed, 64 ships each, hex movement with fuel mass
  costs, auto-dock/merge/refuel at home.
- **Combat** — round-based vs pirates, shields absorb first, rapid-fire
  chains (corvettes shred scouts…), victors drop salvage (`FleetDestroyed.salvage`
  is exactly the pile `collect_salvage` can take; it lasts 60 ticks and a
  `SalvageDespawned` event says when one expires). You only receive combat
  events for fights your fleets or homeworld are in, or that happen in a
  sector where you have a fleet or your homeworld. Each carries `owner`
  (empire name, `null` for NPCs) and `mine`; losing a fleet also raises a
  `Critical` `Alert`. Hostile ids in a sector view are the ids `attack` and
  `CombatStarted.enemy_fleet_id` use. `ResourceHarvested` is one event per fleet
  every 10 ticks (and when harvesting stops).
- **Scanning** — active `scan` reveals connected sectors (2 hops with a Scout
  in fleet, 1 without) and picks up *signals* one hop farther: rich ore,
  hostile mass, derelicts, anomalies. Scan intel is live for ~2 minutes.
  After that the sector stays on your chart: the server remembers every
  sector you have had eyes on, and `full_state.known_sectors` returns all of
  them. Each entry has `live` (true: current this tick; false: remembered) and
  `last_seen` (tick it was last observed). A stale entry shows ore, hostiles,
  wreckage and derelict **as last seen**, which may be out of date (wreckage
  lasts 60 ticks; `salvage_despawn_tick` says when). Tick updates add a
  sector to `sector_updates` once more when it turns stale.
- **Derelicts** — dead ships drift in debris fields and empty space beyond
  the shipping lanes (`D` on the map, "derelict transponder" on scans).
  Board one (`explore_site`, 20 ticks) for tiered loot, sometimes a
  recoverable ship or an instant-tech data core — or an ambush by whatever
  killed the crew. Aborted/failed boardings leave the site *hotter*. A
  Scout aboard reads the risk down; a Hauler doubles the haul.
- **Standing orders** — assign a fleet a doctrine and the server flies it
  (see `policy_update` above). Doctrines respect fuel/cargo thresholds,
  return home to deposit and refuel, and log every decision.
- **Raids** — once your empire is worth raiding (Shipyard ≥ 2 or a Defense
  Grid), pirates occasionally vector at your homeworld. You get a warning
  (`RaidIncoming`, ~60 ticks), docked ships + Defense Grid auto-defend,
  repelling drops bonus salvage in orbit, losing costs a hard-capped slice
  of stockpiles (≤8%) — never buildings, never queues, and a lost raid
  buys you a long grace period.


## Feedback (required, when under 6 minutes remain)

Write `feedback.md` in your player directory with these sections:

1. **Result**: final resources, buildings, research, ships; what you achieved.
2. **Strategy**: what you tried, what worked, what did not.
3. **Fun and clarity**: was the game understandable from these rules and the
   tool output? What confused you?
4. **Bugs and oddities**: anything that looked wrong (quote the event or error).
5. **Balance**: anything too strong, too weak, too slow, or pointless.
6. **Top 3 suggestions** to make the game better for AI and human players.
7. **The `play` tool**: what would have made it easier to play.

Be specific and honest; this feedback goes to the game's developer.
